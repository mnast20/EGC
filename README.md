Repository for Computer Graphics Subject, it contains all the laboratories, as well as three projects

## Project 1: Duck Hunt
It is a 2D game, where the player has to shoot ducks in order to increase their score. For each shot duck, 10 points are added. The game ends in a victory when the player has reached 1000 points, or in a loss, when three lives have been lost. When a player loses a life, it means that three bullets haven't hit their mark, or a duck managed to escape. The game gets progressively faster, the ducks gradually increasing their speed. For every five ducks, the speed increases.

## Project 2: Car Race
As the name states, it is a 3D car racing game. The player uses a third person view in order to maneuver the vehicle. Collisions have been implemented, so that when the car hits the margins of th track or another dynamic obstacle, it is briefly stopped. The track was generated using Geogebra and mathematical functions, that are stated in the project link. Trees were also generated along the track, and images were added in order to simulate a tour of Tokyo. The other cars have a fixed route along the race track segments, rotating based on the direction they are moving in. The car is controlled using the WASD keys, and speed can be increased when pressing the Shift key, as long as the speed meter on the left (the red bar) is fully charged.

## Project 3: SkiFree3D
A 3D game where the player has a third person view above the skier that is controlled by using the mouse. The slope, a big square, technically moves along with the skier, but this cannot be seen by the camera. Different types of objects are generated on the slope: collectibles (presents), as well as obstacles (rocks, trees and light poles). Whenever an object cannot be seen anymore, it is deleted, so that another one can be created. Whenever a present is collected, 10 points are added to the score. However, when an obstacle is hit, the game will end. The presents emit a punctiform light, as well as the trees. Another thing to note is the fact that the game has two modes: skiing and snowboarding, from which the player can choose based on preference.
